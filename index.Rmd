## Visualizing probability distributions across bivariate cyclic temporal granularities



---

# Main contributions

 - provide a formal characterization of cyclic granularities;
 - facilitate manipulation of single- and multiple-order-up time granularities through cyclic calendar algebra;
 - develop an approach to check the feasibility of creating plots or drawing inferences for any two cyclic granularities.

# Project 2: Contributions

 - introduce a new distance measure for quantifying periodic interactions;
 - device a framework for choosing a threshold for detecting only significantly interesting periodic patterns;
 - show that the proposed distance metric is useful for ranking different periodic patterns since they have been normalized for relevant parameters.

## Make asymmetrical distributed real world observed variables more treatable

The empirical **Normal Quantile Transform** involves the following steps:

  1. 1) Sort the sample of measured variable $X$ from the smallest to the largest observation $x_{(1)},\dots, x_{(i)}, .., x_{(n)}$.
  2. 2) Estimate the cumulative probabilities $p_{(1)},\dots, p_{(i)}, .., p_{(n)}$.
  3. 3) Transforming each observation $x_{(i)}$ of $X$ into observation $y_{(i)} = Q^{-1}(p(i))$ of the standard normal variate $Y$ , with $Q$ denoting the standard normal distribution and $Q^{-1}$ its inverse.

# Project 2: Computation (continued)

## Computing distance between distributions using Jensen-Shannon distance

$$JSD(q_1||q_2) = \frac{1}{2}D(q_1||M) + \frac{1}{2}D(q_2||M)$$
where $M = \frac{q_1+q_2}{2}$ and 
$D(q_1||q_2) := \int^\infty_{-\infty} q_1(x)f(\frac{q_1(x)}{q_2(x)})$ is the KL divergence between distributions $q_1$ and $q_2$.
