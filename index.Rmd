## Visualizing probability distributions across bivariate cyclic temporal granularities



---

# Main contributions

 - provide a formal characterization of cyclic granularities;
 - facilitate manipulation of single- and multiple-order-up time granularities through cyclic calendar algebra;
 - develop an approach to check the feasibility of creating plots or drawing inferences for any two cyclic granularities.

##  Project 2: A new metric for automatic discovery of periodic patterns in time series

---

# Project 2: Contributions

 - introduce a new distance measure for quantifying periodic interactions, which allows for identification of patterns in the time series data;
 - device a framework for choosing a threshold, which results in detection of only significantly interesting periodic patterns;
 - show that the proposed distance metric could be used to rank the periodic patterns based on how well they capture the variation in the measured variable since they have been normalized for relevant parameters.

# Project 2: Computation (continued)

## Make asymmetrical distributed real world observed variables more treatable

.smaller[
The empirical **Normal Quantile Transform** involves the following steps:

  1. 1) Sort the sample of measured variable $X$ from the smallest to the largest observation $x_{(1)},\dots, x_{(i)}, .., x_{(n)}$.
  2. 2) Estimate the cumulative probabilities $p_{(1)},\dots, p_{(i)}, .., p_{(n)}$.
  3. 3) Transforming each observation $x_{(i)}$ of $X$ into observation $y_{(i)} = Q^{-1}(p(i))$ of the standard normal variate $Y$ , with $Q$ denoting the standard normal distribution and $Q^{-1}$ its inverse.

# Project 2: Computation (continued)

## Computing distance between distributions using Jensen-Shannon distance

$$JSD(q_1||q_2) = \frac{1}{2}D(q_1||M) + \frac{1}{2}D(q_2||M)$$
where $M = \frac{q_1+q_2}{2}$ and 
$D(q_1||q_2) := \int^\infty_{-\infty} q_1(x)f(\frac{q_1(x)}{q_2(x)})$ is the KL divergence between distributions $q_1$ and $q_2$.

### Values

$nx = \{2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 20, 31, 50\}$  
$nfacet = \{2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 20, 31, 50\}$

**_Distribution changes across different comparisons_**

# Project 2: Need to normalize

<br>

$wpd$ values are meant to be different only when there is difference between different categories and not when 

- underlying distributions are different
(solved by using NQT)
- number of categories are different
(solved by normalizing for the number of categories)

1. 1) Fix harmony pair $(A, B)$.

2. 2) Given the data; $\{v_t: t=0, 1, 2, \dots, T-1\}$, the $wpd_{norm}$ is computed and is represented by $wpd_{obs}$.

3. 3) From the original sequence a random permutation is obtained: $\{v_t^*: t=0, 1, 2, \dots, T-1\}$

4. 4) $wpd_{norm}$ is computed for the permuted sequence of the data and is represented by $wpd_{perm_1}$

5. 5) Steps (3) and (4) are repeated a large number
of times $M$ (M = 200)

6. 6) For each permutation, one $wpd_{perm_i}$ is obtained.   Define $wpd_{sample} = \{wpd_{perm_1}, wpd_{perm_2}, \dots, wpd_{perm_M}\}$

7. 7) Repeat Steps (1-6) for all harmony pairs $(A, B) \in H_{N_C}$ and store it in $wpd^{all}_{sample}$

8. 8) $99^{th}$ percentiles of $wpd^{all}_{sample}$ is computed and stored in $wpd_{threshold99}$

9. 9) If $wpd_{obs_{A, B}} > wpd_{threshold99}$, harmony pair $(A, B)$ is selected with a 99% level of significance and otherwise rejected

## Assumptions

.smaller[
- $C_1: \mathbb{Z}_+ \mapsto \{L_1, L_2, L_3, \dots, L_m \}$
- $C_2: \mathbb{Z}_+ \mapsto \{L_1, L_2, L_3, \dots, L_p \}$
- $S(i, j, k)$: set of measurement variables corresponding to the key $i$ for $k^{th}$ level of $C_1$ and $j^{th}$ level of $C_2$
- $P(i, j, k)$: probability distribution of the measured variable corresponding to the set $S(i, j, k)$
- each observational unit $i$ will have $mp$ variables each of which is a probability distribution
- clustering algorithm on these $P(i, j, k)$ instead of raw data

# Clustering temporal data based on <br> probability distributions

## Implications
- Dimension reduction
- Robust to outliers by trimming the tails
- Non-synchronized observed time periods
- Similar periodic behavior
- Handling autocorrelation

# Study of Australian smart meter data

.smaller[
* Provide preliminary exploratory visualization and summarisation
* Employ cluster analysis to obtain households showing similar periodic behavior and combine the findings with external data like weather conditions, socio-economic or other demographic factors of those households
* Comparative study with earlier methods which focused on clustering raw data across linear time scales as opposed to clustering probability distributions across periodic scales
